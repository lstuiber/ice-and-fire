# ice-and-fire

For this challenge we will use an anapioficeandfire - https://anapioficeandfire.com/

The challenge is to use asyncronous JavaScript, your program should start with accessing the first book:

- This is done at this URL - https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books/1
- By using the data from that URL, it should derive the povCharacter urls for the fist book
- It should then use these urls to fetch the details of each pov character
- For each character, the program should make a file on your computer in a known location, and write the following data to it:
  - the characters name
  - the characters gender
  - the characters culture
  - is the chahracter alive?
  - any titles the character has
  - the name of any allegiances the character has
 
  
This is a filer per charecter from the book
